                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the 
                printing and typesetting industry. Lorem 
                Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
                printer took a <b>galley</b> of type and scrambled it 
                to make a type specimen book. 
                <span style="color:blue;"> It was 
                 popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
                 sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more 
                 recently with desktop publishing software like 
                 Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
